      "description": "I've never really liked the feel of 150 rpm Scout Rifles until this one came along and a good amount of people I've talked to seem to share this sentiment.\nArrowhead Brake will turn your 74 base recoil into 100, which is pretty good value if you happen to get that. Fluted is a good second option though.\nWith the high base Range of this gun (like 90m), accurized doesn't really offer much so I'd prefer Flared Magwell and possibly Tactical Mag as a second choice.\nRapid Hit to me is one of the (if not the) best perk to have on a Scout Rifle as it gives you so much in terms of Reload Speed and Stability.\nExplosive Payload is a generally good damage perk option on a Scout, but since this is a Stasis one it can also roll Headstone if you're into that.\nRecommended MW: Handling ",

      "description": "For high end content I can't say pellet shotguns have been very desirable for a while and this gun is no exception. Though it does have some fun rolls that you can use in the majority of the game and be just fine. \nFor PvE it's kind of hard to go wrong with barrels on a shotgun, although I'd recommended Corkscrew and Barrel Shroud for the benefit of having extra stats, though I wouldn't blame anyone for preferring Full Choke either.\nAggressive Shotguns have a pretty low RPM compared to other shotguns so bumping that feel up slightly with Assault Mag is nice, though I'd also say Accurized Rounds are just as good to bump up that range slightly.\nSubsistence is pretty fun on a shotgun as it basically just allows you to run at the enemy and shoot until you're out of reserves if you're doing content that allows you to do so, but Ensemble is nice for group content for that Reload and Handling boost while Lead From Gold is also there if you feel you're lacking on Ammo. (Kind of want to try out Steady Hands tbh).\nVorpal Weapon stands out to me as the best damage option, but Adrenaline Junkie is also a very viable option if you're one to run Grenade builds.\nRecommended MW: Range or Handling",

Though it requires you to manually reload which makes it less desirable in my opinion. \nVorpal is not a bad option if you want some extra damage on your Blinding Grenades, though this isn't what you're ideally using them for so having Demolitionist where you can have another shot on demand in case of emergency is nice and Disruption Break can be neat for higher end content where there's Match Game and Solar Shields. \nRecommended MW: Velocity",
