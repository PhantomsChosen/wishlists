Arrowhead Brake will turn your 74 base recoil into 100, which is pretty good value if you happen to get that. Fluted is a good second option though. With the high base Range of this gun (like 90m), accurized doesn't really offer much so I'd prefer Flared Magwell and possibly Tactical Mag as a second choice. Rapid Hit to me is one of the (if not the) best perk to have on a Scout Rifle as it gives you so much in terms of Reload Speed and Stability. Explosive Payload is a generally good damage perk option on a Scout, but since this is a Stasis one it can also roll Headstone if you're into that.

Though it does have some fun rolls that you can use in the majority of the game and be just fine. For PvE it's kind of hard to go wrong with barrels on a shotgun, although I'd recommended Corkscrew and Barrel Shroud for the benefit of having extra stats, though I wouldn't blame anyone for preferring Full Choke either. Aggressive Shotguns have a pretty low RPM compared to other shotguns so bumping that feel up slightly with Assault Mag is nice, though I'd also say Accurized Rounds are just as good to bump up that range slightly. Subsistence is pretty fun on a shotgun as it basically just allows you to run at the enemy and shoot until you're out of reserves if you're doing content that allows you to do so, but Ensemble is nice for group content for that Reload and Handling boost while Lead From Gold is also there if you feel you're lacking on Ammo. (Kind of want to try out Steady Hands tbh). Vorpal Weapon stands out to me as the best damage option, but Adrenaline Junkie is also a very viable option if you're one to run Grenade builds.

Arrowhead Brake / Hammerforged is the ideal here along with Accurized or Flared. Stats For All gives a ton of stats which is easily procced on this weapon. If you wish to take down Barrier Champions faster you'd want to go for Vorpal or if you're doing grenade builds Demo is your choice. In the end I'd rather run with One For All due to the synergy it has with Stats For All though.

Though it does have some fun rolls that you can use in the majority of the game and be just fine. For PvE it's kind of hard to go wrong with barrels on a shotgun, although I'd recommended Corkscrew and Barrel Shroud for the benefit of having extra stats, though I wouldn't blame anyone for preferring Full Choke either. Aggressive Shotguns have a pretty low RPM compared to other shotguns so bumping that feel up slightly with Assault Mag is nice, though I'd also say Accurized Rounds are just as good to bump up that range slightly. Subsistence is pretty fun on a shotgun as it basically just allows you to run at the enemy and shoot until you're out of reserves if you're doing content that allows you to do so, but Ensemble is nice for group content for that Reload and Handling boost while Lead From Gold is also there if you feel you're lacking on Ammo. (Kind of want to try out Steady Hands tbh). Vorpal Weapon stands out to me as the best damage option, but Adrenaline Junkie is also a very viable option if you're one to run Grenade builds.
