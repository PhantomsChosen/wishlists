Arrowhead Brake will turn your 74 base recoil into 100, which is pretty good value if you happen to get that. Fluted is a good second option though. With the high base Range of this gun (like 90m), accurized doesn't really offer much so I'd prefer Flared Magwell and possibly Tactical Mag as a second choice. Rapid Hit to me is one of the (if not the) best perk to have on a Scout Rifle as it gives you so much in terms of Reload Speed and Stability. Explosive Payload is a generally good damage perk option on a Scout, but since this is a Stasis one it can also roll Headstone if you're into that.

Though it does have some fun rolls that you can use in the majority of the game and be just fine. For PvE it's kind of hard to go wrong with barrels on a shotgun, although I'd recommended Corkscrew and Barrel Shroud for the benefit of having extra stats, though I wouldn't blame anyone for preferring Full Choke either. Aggressive Shotguns have a pretty low RPM compared to other shotguns so bumping that feel up slightly with Assault Mag is nice, though I'd also say Accurized Rounds are just as good to bump up that range slightly. Subsistence is pretty fun on a shotgun as it basically just allows you to run at the enemy and shoot until you're out of reserves if you're doing content that allows you to do so, but Ensemble is nice for group content for that Reload and Handling boost while Lead From Gold is also there if you feel you're lacking on Ammo. (Kind of want to try out Steady Hands tbh). Vorpal Weapon stands out to me as the best damage option, but Adrenaline Junkie is also a very viable option if you're one to run Grenade builds.

Arrowhead Brake and Fluted Barrel are solid options for Pulse Rifles. High Caliber Rounds are nice to stun lock some red bars, but you're not losing much by opting into Light Mag or other options that give Range or Reload Speed either. Outlaw is pretty much the only good choice in your third column, but if you're running Frenzy you might have fun with Enhanced Hip-Fire Grip. Vorpal and Frenzy are your damage options here, but you can opt into Headstone if you're doing Stasis shenanigans.

The SMG already has pretty high Handling so I prefer to go for Hammerforged here to try and get some extra Range, with Smallbore being a solid second option. Seraph Rounds give a bonus to Zoom, so this is the best option by far in terms of Mag, but you can opt into Accurized Rounds or Flared Magwell if you didn't end up with Seraph. Subsistence is a solid perk, but you can also opt into Pulse Monitor or Threat Detector if you prefer that. Vorpal is going to be your go to damage perk, while Demolitionist is there if you wish to spec into grenade builds.

Though it does have some fun rolls that you can use in the majority of the game and be just fine. For PvE it's kind of hard to go wrong with barrels on a shotgun, although I'd recommended Corkscrew and Barrel Shroud for the benefit of having extra stats, though I wouldn't blame anyone for preferring Full Choke either. Aggressive Shotguns have a pretty low RPM compared to other shotguns so bumping that feel up slightly with Assault Mag is nice, though I'd also say Accurized Rounds are just as good to bump up that range slightly. Subsistence is pretty fun on a shotgun as it basically just allows you to run at the enemy and shoot until you're out of reserves if you're doing content that allows you to do so, but Ensemble is nice for group content for that Reload and Handling boost while Lead From Gold is also there if you feel you're lacking on Ammo. (Kind of want to try out Steady Hands tbh). Vorpal Weapon stands out to me as the best damage option, but Adrenaline Junkie is also a very viable option if you're one to run Grenade builds.
