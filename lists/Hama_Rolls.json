Though it does have some fun rolls that you can use in the majority of the game and be just fine. For PvE it's kind of hard to go wrong with barrels on a shotgun, although I'd recommended Corkscrew and Barrel Shroud for the benefit of having extra stats, though I wouldn't blame anyone for preferring Full Choke either. Aggressive Shotguns have a pretty low RPM compared to other shotguns so bumping that feel up slightly with Assault Mag is nice, though I'd also say Accurized Rounds are just as good to bump up that range slightly. Subsistence is pretty fun on a shotgun as it basically just allows you to run at the enemy and shoot until you're out of reserves if you're doing content that allows you to do so, but Ensemble is nice for group content for that Reload and Handling boost while Lead From Gold is also there if you feel you're lacking on Ammo.
